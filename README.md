# JPEGView
JPEGView is a viewer/editor for JPEG, BMP, WEBP, PNG, TGA, RAW, GIF and TIFF images. It is designed to view images from digital cameras full screen and with highest quality possible. Basic image editing functionality is provided - allowing to correct typical problems as color cast, high/low contrast and under- or overexposure very quickly and interactively during review of the images. JPEGView does not replace a full blown image editor - such an editor will just be needed less often.
